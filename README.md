# Lambda Layers For chrome-aws-lambda
Lambda layers automatically deployed from [chrome-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda) builds.

This repo checks for changes weekly so if you need a release sooner, open an issue and I'll trigger a workflow run.

Similarly if this doesn't currently deploy to a region you need, open an issue and I'll add it
# Getting Started
